* I applied the MVVM design pattern with rx data binding.
    
* I applied the Coordinator patterrn for handling navigation in the app.

* I use SwiftLint for swift style and to be consistent on my coding style .

* I installed some dependencies:
   - `Moya/RxSwift` and `RxCocoa`: for handling network and binding the data.
